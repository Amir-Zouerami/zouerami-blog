# Note
This repository is archived and had major problems (mostly shit code). I am currently working on v2.0!

# What is this?
This is my persoanl blog and my portfolio which is hosted at [zouerami.dev](https://zouerami.dev).


# Technologies
The main framwork behind this website is Next.js v14.0.4. I use Pocketbase as the database and Tailwind to style everything. It uses some other packages:
- `html-react-parser`: helps parse and customize some content from rich text editor.
- `zod`: good ol' validation.
- `bright`: pretty syntax highlighting for code snippets which supports server rendering.
- `react-markdown`: allows you to use markdown in react. I use it for blog comments.
- `jotai`: react state management.
- `react-hot-toast`: great toast notification tool.
- `next-themes`: for dark mode without flashing.
- `react-confetti`: some flamboyant confetti business.
- `sharp`: resizing images.
- `dayjs`: great minimal library for time-management.

The entire thing is behind a CDN as well.

You can use whatever you find useful from this project but some credit would be nice.


# Contibution
I appreciate you all but this is a personal project and I will NOT accept any pull requests. The only reason this project is open-source, besides my love for open-source, is for it to act as a portfolio.
